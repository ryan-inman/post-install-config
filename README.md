</p>
<p>
<b>Step 1: Configure Roles</b>
<br />
 "<a href="https://docs.osticket.com/en/latest/Admin/Agents/Roles.html">Roles</a> are the permissions granted to Agents per Department that they have access to. Each Role has a set of permissions that can be checked/unchecked for agents given that Role in association with a Department they have access to. An unlimited number of roles can be created and assigned to Agents with access to various departments."
</p>
<br />

<p>
Click Agents -> Roles -> Add New Role. Enter the name "Supreme Admin" for the role and then navigate to the Permissions tab. Enable every permission in "Tickets", "Tasks" and "Knowledgebase". Make sure to save changes.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<b>Step 2: Configure Departments</b>
<br />
"Since tickets are routed through <a href="https://docs.osticket.com/en/latest/Admin/Agents/Departments.html">Departments</a> in the help desk, there are many settings that can be set for each Department."
</p>
<br />

<p>
Click Agents -> Departments -> Add New Department. Name the new department "System Administrators" and click Create Dept.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<b>Step 3: Configure Teams</b>
<br />
"<a href="https://docs.osticket.com/en/latest/Admin/Agents/Teams.html">Teams</a> allow you to pull Agents from different Departments and organize them to handle a specific issue or user via a Help Topic or Ticket Filter."
</p>
<br />

<p>
Click Agents -> Teams -> Add New Teams. Name the team "Level II Support", add yourself to the team and select Create Team.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<b>Step 4: Allow anyone to create tickets</b>
<br />
Click Settings -> User Settings. Check the box that says "Require registration and login to create tickets" and save changes.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<b>Step 5: Configure Agents</b>
<br />
"<a href="https://docs.osticket.com/en/latest/Admin/Agents/Agents.html">Agents</a> are given access to the help desk with the intent to respond and resolve the tickets. When adding an Agent to the help desk, they will need to be assigned to a Primary Department and given a Primary Role for the Tickets/Tasks routed to that department. Agents can be given Extended Access to additional departments of the help desk as well as assigned different Roles to those departments; this can be configured in the Access tab of the Agentâ€™s Profile."
</p>
<br />

<p>
Click Agents -> Add New Agent. For this lab we will be creating two agents. For each agent fill out the Name, Email and Username fields then set a password (do not require a reset or change). 
</p>
<br />

<p>
In the Access Tab assign Agent 1 to the "Systems Administrators" Department and give extended access to the Support Department. Assign Agent 2 to the "Support" Department.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<b>Step 6: Configure Users</b>
<br />
"<a href="https://docs.osticket.com/en/latest/Agent/Users/User%20Directory.html">Users</a> are the ticket owners of the tickets in the help desk."
</p>
<br />

<p>
Click Agent Panel -> Users -> Add New. Create two users with an email and name.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<b> Step 7: Configure SLA</b>
<br />
  "<a href="https://docs.osticket.com/en/latest/Admin/Manage/SLA%20Plans.html"> SLA</a> Plans or Service Level Agreements, are unlimited in osTicket. The purpose of the SLA Plan is to provide a length of time in which the help desk Administrator expects tickets to be closed."

<p>
Click Admin Panel -> Manage -> SLA. We will create 3 different SLA's.
<br />
 - Sev A (1 hour, 24/7)
<br />
 - Sev B (4 hours, 24/7)
<br />
 - Sev C (8 hours, business hours)
